# Economic-Dispatch-Optimization-of-a-grid-with-Wind-Storage-
Developed an Economic Dispatch Optimization model for an electrical grid integrating wind energy and battery
storage systems. Utilized optimization techniques to minimize generation costs while ensuring demand-supply balance.
Factored in renewable energy variability, storage capacity constraints, and grid efficiency. Analyzed the impact of wind
generation forecasts and storage scheduling on cost reductions and grid stability, contributing to sustainable energy
management.-Python,Pyomo,Gurobi,GAMS.
